# daseAlgo

A repo to record the labs of ADS 2023 course from ECNU

## Course Info

- [Course Website](https://yhwang1990.github.io/ads-2023-spring/)

An excellent course instructed by *Prof. Wang* about some classic algorithms, like Morris, Pagerank and so on.

We need to implement three of these algorithms towards real-word data.

- Lab1 Similarity Search (Ongoing)
- Lab2 Image Compression (TODO)
- Lab3 Recommender System (TODO)

### Goal

I want to use `cpp` to finish all the labs with project-style code. After that, maybe I will try to find other methods to perform better both in algo ways or CS ways.

By the way, this project would include some of my attempts and tools, like time testing tools,and practicing writing makefiles or cmake.
